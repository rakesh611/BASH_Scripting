Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line interpreter and scripting language commonly used on Linux and Unix-like operating systems.
It is both:
An interactive shell ‚Äì lets you type and run commands (like ls, cd, mkdir).
A scripting language ‚Äì you can write .sh or .bash scripts to automate tasks.

# Key Features of Bash:
Default shell in most Linux distributions.
Provides command history, aliases, and tab completion.
Supports variables, loops, functions, and conditionals (like a programming language).
Can run system commands and chain them using operators (|, &&, ;).
Portable across different systems that have Bash installed.

Example:
Run directly in terminal:
# echo "Hello, World!"

Example script (hello.sh):
#!/bin/bash
# A simple Bash script
name="Rakesh"
echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to Bash."

Run it:
bash hello.sh

üëâ In short: Bash is both a shell to interact with the OS and a language to automate tasks.

1. What is a Shell?
A shell is any program that provides an interface between the user and the operating system.
It lets you run commands, manage files, and write scripts.
There are different types of shells: sh, bash, zsh, csh, ksh, etc.
Think of "shell" as the category (like ‚Äúcar‚Äù), and Bash, Zsh, etc., are models (like Toyota, Honda).

2. What is Bash?
Bourne Again SHell (bash) was developed as a replacement for sh (GNU Project, 1989).
Default shell on most Linux distros.
Adds advanced features:
Command history (‚Üë and ‚Üì keys).
Tab auto-completion.
Aliases (alias ll='ls -l').
Scripting improvements ([[ ]], arrays, functions).

3. Other Popular Shells
Zsh (Z shell): More modern, customizable, used in macOS by default since 2019.
Ksh (Korn shell): Adds programming features, used in some enterprise systems.
Csh/Tcsh (C shell): Syntax looks more like C programming language.
