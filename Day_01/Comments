1. What are Comments?
A comment is text in a script that is ignored by the shell.
They are used for explanations, notes, or temporarily disabling code.
In Bash, a comment starts with #.

 Examples
1. Single-line comment
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment
echo "Hello, World!"   # This prints a message

2. Multi-line comment (trick)
Bash doesn’t have a direct multi-line comment, but you can use one of these tricks:
Option 1: Just put # on each line
# This is line 1
# This is line 2
# This is line 3

Option 2: Use a Here Document with : <<'END'
: <<'END'
This is a block comment
It won’t be executed
END

3. Special Note
The first line with #! (shebang) is not a comment — it tells the system which interpreter to use.
Everything else starting with # is a real comment.
