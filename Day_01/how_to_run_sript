1. Create a simple Bash script
Example: hello.sh
#!/bin/bash
# My first bash script
echo "Hello, Rakesh! Welcome to Bash scripting."

2. Ways to Run Bash Scripts
(a) Run with bash command
bash hello.sh
Directly runs the script with the bash interpreter.
Does not need execution permission.
Always runs with Bash, even if the script’s first line (#!...) is different.

(b) Run as executable (./script.sh)
chmod +x hello.sh   # give execute permission
./hello.sh
Uses the shebang (#!/bin/bash) at the top of the script to decide which interpreter to use.
Needs execution permission.
More portable because if you change the shebang to /bin/sh or /usr/bin/python, it will run with that interpreter.

(c) Run with sh command (not always same as bash)
sh hello.sh
Runs with the system’s default sh interpreter (might be Dash, not Bash, in Ubuntu/Debian).

If the script has Bash-specific syntax (arrays, [[ ]]), it may break.

3. Key Differences
| Method           | Needs `chmod +x`? | Uses Shebang? | Always Bash?       |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `bash script.sh` | ❌ No              | ❌ Ignored     | ✅ Yes              |
| `./script.sh`    | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes         | Depends on shebang |
| `sh script.sh`   | ❌ No              | ❌ Ignored     | ❌ No (system `sh`) |
