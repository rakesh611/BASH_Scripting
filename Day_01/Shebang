What is Shebang?
The first line in most scripts:
#!/bin/bash
#! (called shebang or hashbang) tells the system which interpreter should run the script.

Example:
#!/bin/bash → run with Bash
#!/bin/sh → run with default system shell
#!/usr/bin/python3 → run with Python
#!/usr/bin/env bash → run with Bash found in the user’s PATH

How It Works
When you run:
./script.sh
The kernel checks the first line of the file.
If it starts with #!, it uses the specified interpreter.
That interpreter runs the rest of the script.
