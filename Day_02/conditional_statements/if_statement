if are used to make decisions based on conditions.
They check whether a condition is true or false and then execute commands accordingly.

Basic Syntax of if:-
if [ condition ]
then
    # commands to execute if condition is true
fi

Example
#!/bin/bash
num=10

if [ $num -gt 5 ]
then
    echo "Number is greater than 5"
fi

âœ… Output: Number is greater than 5
