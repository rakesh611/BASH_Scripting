A nested if means putting one if statement inside another.
This is useful when you want to check a condition only if another condition is already true.

Syntax of Nested If:-
if [ condition1 ]
then
    if [ condition2 ]
    then
        # commands if both condition1 AND condition2 are true
    else
        # commands if condition2 is false
    fi
else
    # commands if condition1 is false
fi

Example â€“ Age and Citizenship
#!/bin/bash
age=20
citizen="yes"

if [ $age -ge 18 ]
then
    if [ $citizen = "yes" ]
    then
        echo "You are eligible to vote"
    else
        echo "You must be a citizen to vote"
    fi
else
    echo "You are not old enough to vote"
fi

âœ… Output: You are eligible to vote

ðŸ”‘ Key Points about Nested If:
The inner if runs only if the outer if is true.
It helps to check multiple related conditions.
But if you have many conditions, itâ€™s often cleaner to use elif instead of too much nesting.
