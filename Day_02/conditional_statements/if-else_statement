The else block in a Bash if statement is used to execute commands when the condition is false.

Syntax of if-else:-
if [ condition ]
then
    # commands if condition is true
else
    # commands if condition is false
fi

Example – Number Check
#!/bin/bash
num=5

if [ $num -gt 10 ]
then
    echo "Number is greater than 10"
else
    echo "Number is less than or equal to 10"
fi
✅ Output: Number is less than or equal to 10
