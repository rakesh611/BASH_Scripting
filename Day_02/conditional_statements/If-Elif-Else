The elif (short for else if) is used when you want to test multiple conditions in sequence.
It sits between if and else.

Syntax:-
if [ condition1 ]
then
    # commands if condition1 is true
elif [ condition2 ]
then
    # commands if condition2 is true
elif [ condition3 ]
then
    # commands if condition3 is true
else
    # commands if none of the above are true
fi


Example:
#!/bin/bash
marks=75

if [ $marks -ge 90 ]
then
    echo "Grade: A"
elif [ $marks -ge 75 ]
then
    echo "Grade: B"
else
    echo "Grade: C"
fi
